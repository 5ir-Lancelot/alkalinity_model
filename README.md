# Code Description
In the modules file there are two different functions.

Both calculate the carbonate alkalinity (A<sub>C</sub>) in eq/kgw for a given water sample.

The definition for A<sub>C</sub> that is taken in both models is:

$$ A_C = [ HCO_3^- ] + [ CO_3^{2-} ] $$ 


## Model 1 A<sub>C</sub>(pH, DIC,T)
This model takes 




## Model 2 A<sub>C</sub>(pH, DIC, T, major cations, major anions)
